## Don't Wreck My House â€“ Java Reservation Management System
An end-to-end **Java console application** for managing vacation home reservations. Designed with clean architecture principles and built using object-oriented programming, layered design, and modern Java tools.

This project simulates the operations of a platform similar to Airbnb, with support for adding, viewing, editing, and canceling reservations between guests and hosts.

### Features

* **Domain-Specific Rules:**
  * Prevent overlapping reservations
  * Restrict reservation cancellation after the start date
  * Accurate calculation of costs using `BigDecimal`

### Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java
* **Build Tool:** Maven
